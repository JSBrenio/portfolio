## Overview

---

During my Summer Quarter after my Junior year, I wanted to learn more about graphs and web development, both exciting but new to me. So as part of my algorithms course's extra credit, I combined both goals and tried to make a static web application using vanilla JavaScript, HTML Canvas, and CSS.

I got to experience the chaotic language that is JavaScript, which quickly became one of my favorite languages coming from a Java-based background. The loosely typed (if any) experience was refreshing, I fondly remember adding a "weight" property to my matrix of coordinates on-the-fly and going "I can do that???" before summarily suffering the consequences when everything else broke.

The worse thing I had to experience was a broken webpage without any warnings from the console logs... spending almost half the day finding the bug, only for it be ONE WHITESPACE character in the HTML. I was able to contain my frustration spilling over to my git commit message: "Bug Fix"

But I got to finally learn graphing and pathfinding algorithms, something that was a blindspot in my knowledge. Working with queues and sets to traverse a coordinate grid translated naturally to graphs with vertices and tree structures. With this deeper understanding, I no longer need to memorize exact implementationsâ€”by following the process step by step, I can confidently work through the logic in any coding langauge I want.

## Walkthrough

The application opens with a comprehensive sidebar containing algorithm controls and a center grid to show the pathfinding visually.

Users begin by selecting their preferred pathfinding algorithm from the available options: A* (with Manhattan, Euclidean, Chebyshev, or Octile heuristics), Dijkstra's algorithm, or Breadth-First Search.

<div class="walkthrough-section">
    <div class="walkthrough-content">

**Grid Interaction:**

- Click to draw walls on the grid
- Use the random maze generator with adjustable wall density (0-100%)
- Add random weight to grid cells to showcase weighted pathfinding
- Clear or reset the grid as needed
- Save grid as image appended with algorithm statistics

**Algorithm Configuration:**

- Choose between different pathfinding algorithms
- For A*, select from four heuristic functions optimized for different scenarios
  - Manhattan (city-block distance)
  - Euclidean (straight-line distance)
  - Chebyshev (chessboard distance)
  - Octile (optimized for 8-directional movement)
- Enable diagonal movement for more flexible pathfinding
- Toggle weights to simulate varied terrain costs
- Turn off sleep mode for faster execution during data collection
