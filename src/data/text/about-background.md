## My Journey

<!-- ### Early Life

Since my **9th birthday** when I got my first gaming console—the **Xbox 360**—I knew at a young age I wanted to be in a field of **creation**. I would always *marvel* at game mechanics and *wonder* how technology works. But I didn’t know what programming was, nor had the resources to explore it. -->

### High School

It was in high school where I learned more about **computers**, I was interested in **logic-based thinking**, from playing educational games that included basic constructs like `loops` and `conditionals`. Then I learned what **programming** was when I took an introduction to **computer science** class using `Scratch`. Unfortunately, my *pursuit* of computer science was cut short when the program was *removed*, and **COVID-19** put my aspirations on hold.

### College

In the wake of **COVID**, as life *slowly* returned to **normal**, I wanted to pursue something **STEM**-related, unsure if computer science was truly for me. I enrolled at my local community college and pursued a **science-focused degree track**. I explored subjects like **physics** and **electrical engineering**—each fascinating in its own way—but it was learning `Python` and `Java` and *creating* **projects** in beginner programming courses that solidified my *passion* for **technology**.

### University

Though *nervous* to transition to university, I was *excited* to dive deeper into the major, and being surrounded by other passionate, curious computer scientists gave me a sense of **belonging** that only *strengthened* my **determination**. **Imposter Syndrome** quickly *evaporated* as I learned many fascinating **fundamentals** alongside my peers. *Developing* software, *learning* multiple **languages** and **paradigms**, and *demystifying* the **computer**, but the ***greatest experience*** was *working* in a **team**. Through the many group projects I've had, **good** and **challenging**, I *discovered* that **collaborating** with others didn’t just sharpen my skills—it *fueled* my **passion** for creating software together.

## My Goals

- ***Building*** **software** that makes a *difference*, alongside **like-minded developers**.  

- ***Creating*** **technologies** that *positively* **impact people**—and seeing that impact firsthand.  

- ***Thriving*** in any **production environment** while *embracing* **ideation and creation**.
