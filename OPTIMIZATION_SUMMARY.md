# Project Optimization Summary

This project has been optimized following the official React + TypeScript + Vite recommendations:

## Key Optimizations Applied

### 1. SWC Plugin Migration
- **Changed from**: `@vitejs/plugin-react` (Babel-based)  
- **Changed to**: `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` (SWC-based)
- **Benefits**: Significantly faster compilation and Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

### 2. ESLint Configuration Upgrade
- **Migrated from**: Legacy `.eslintrc.js` configuration
- **Migrated to**: Modern flat config `eslint.config.js`
- **Enhanced with**:
  - Type-aware linting rules (`@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked`)
  - Stylistic type-checked rules for better code quality
  - React plugin with React 18.3 settings
  - Proper JSX runtime configuration

### 3. Build Optimizations
- **Manual chunking**: Separate vendor, router, and markdown chunks for better caching
- **Increased chunk size limit**: Set to 1000kB (appropriate for portfolio sites)
- **HMR overlay disabled**: Better development experience

### 4. Type Safety Improvements
- **Strict type checking**: Enhanced TypeScript rules for better code quality
- **Project references**: Proper TypeScript project configuration
- **No unused variables**: Strict linting for cleaner code

## Performance Benefits
- **Faster builds**: SWC provides 20x faster compilation than Babel
- **Better HMR**: Near-instant updates during development
- **Optimized bundles**: Separate chunks improve loading and caching
- **Type safety**: Catch more errors at compile time

## Developer Experience Improvements
- **Modern ESLint**: Flat config format with better error messages
- **React-specific rules**: Proper JSX and hooks linting
- **Auto-fixing**: Many style issues can be automatically resolved
- **Better IDE integration**: Enhanced TypeScript support

The project now follows current best practices and should provide a significantly improved development experience with faster build times and better code quality enforcement.
